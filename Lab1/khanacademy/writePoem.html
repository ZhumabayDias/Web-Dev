        <h2>Song</h2>
        <p>
            In this world where the stars shine so bright,<br>
There’s a guy everyone talks about at night.<br>
He holds his dreams like a flame in his hands,<br>
His name is Almas—he shines like the sands.<br><br>

Almas, your soul’s a glowing light,<br>
You move ahead, no fear in sight.<br>
You’re like the wind, so wild and free,<br>
Almas, your fire burns endlessly.<br><br>

His courage’s a storm, his gaze’s like the skies,<br>
But a kind, golden sun lives in his eyes.<br>
He’s strong but knows how to dream and create,<br>
Spreading his energy to illuminate.<br><br>

Almas, your soul’s a glowing light,<br>
You move ahead, no fear in sight.<br>
You’re like the wind, so wild and free,<br>
Almas, your fire burns endlessly.<br><br>

Every day’s a new peak to climb,<br>
You pave the way and leave your sign.<br>
There’s power in your eyes, it’s clear,<br>
Almas, you shine brighter than the spheres.<br><br>

Almas, may your star forever gleam,<br>
You’re like a beacon, guarding dreams.<br>
May this song inspire you to soar,<br>
Almas, your fire will burn evermore.<br><br>
        </p>
